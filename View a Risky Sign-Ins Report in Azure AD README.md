# 🚨 Azure Entra ID – View and Investigate Risky Sign-Ins Report

## 📌 Project Overview

This hands-on lab demonstrates how to analyze and investigate the **Risky Sign-Ins Report** in Microsoft Entra ID Identity Protection.

The Risky Sign-Ins report provides administrators with up to 30 days of filterable data related to authentication events classified as risky. These risk signals are generated by Microsoft's threat intelligence and machine learning systems.

This lab focuses on:

- Viewing risky sign-ins
- Analyzing risk levels
- Reviewing detection types
- Evaluating Conditional Access impact
- Confirming events as compromised or safe

### Step 2 – Analyze Risk Overview

1. From the Identity Protection menu, select Risky sign-ins under the Report section

2. The report displays all sign-in events that have been flagged as risky

3. Review the default columns:

- Date - When the sign-in occurred
- User - Who attempted to sign in
- IP address - Source IP of the sign-in
- Location - Geographical location
- Risk state - Current status (At risk, Confirmed compromised, etc.)
